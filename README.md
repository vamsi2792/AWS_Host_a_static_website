# AWS_Hosting_a_static_website

🚀 Just wrapped up a thrilling Amazon S3 project—challenge mode engaged! 🔍

In this project, I:

✅ Created and configured an Amazon S3 bucket, complete with ACLs, versioning, and public access.

✅ Uploaded website content, diving deep into how static websites function and how to host them on S3.

✅ Tackled public access settings and fixed an interesting challenge with the website's visibility.

📸 See my journey from creating buckets to deploying a fully functional static website in my documentation.
